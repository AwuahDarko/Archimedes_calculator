Archimedes is a simple arithmetic calculator written in C++ using the Qt framework.
Currently it is fully functional, that is you can build and run it on your computer (Windows, Mac OS, Linus) provided your have Qt creater. 

This project uses Qt Widgets and Stylesheets. 
Sqlite is used as backend to stored computed answers from the calculator. 

You can freely modify and use this source code for any purpose without restriction.
